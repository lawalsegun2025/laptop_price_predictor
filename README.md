## Motivation
How awesome will it be to be able to know the price range of the type of laptop you will like to buy. This project solves this problem. With this model you can have a range of price of the specifications of the type of laptop you will like to purchase.

## Problem Solving Steps

1. Loading the Data into Pandas Data frame
2. Data Preprocessing and Visualization
3. Model Building (selecting the best Algorithm for prediction)
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (setting the right parameters for the algorithm)
5. Saving the model into a Pickle File and Integrating it with UI
6. Deploying the Application on Heroku Cloud Platform
