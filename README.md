## Overview

This project is about predictiong the price of a laptop based on common features like Memory, Processor and many more attributes.

## Problem Solving Steps

1. Loading the Data into Pandas Data frame
2. Data Preprocessing and Visualization
3. Model Building (selecting the best Algorithm for prediction)
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (setting the right parameters for the algorithm)
5. Saving the model into a Pickle File and Integrating it with UI
6. Deploying the Application on Heroku Cloud Platform
